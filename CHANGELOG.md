# CHANGELOG.md

## 2025-10-27 - COMPREHENSIVE CI/CD FIXES (BLOCKED BY COOLIFY)

### Fixes Applied ✅
- Fixed ES module compatibility (server.js → server.cjs)
- Updated build process to use multi-site builder
- Fixed Dockerfile with Node 20 and proper user permissions
- Updated Nixpacks configuration with correct healthcheck
- Fixed GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow
- Updated build verification scripts for multi-site validation
- Created comprehensive documentation

### Current Status ❌
- **Application**: Fully functional and ready for deployment
- **Build**: Successful multi-site builds working
- **Local Testing**: All health checks passing
- **Deployment**: BLOCKED by Coolify infrastructure permission issues
- **Root Cause**: Coolify cannot write .env and docker-compose.yaml files

### Technical Details
- Build completes successfully
- Server starts correctly on port 3000
- Health endpoint /api/health functional
- Multi-site architecture working (247420, schwepe)
- Issue: Coolify server permission problems

### Next Steps Required
1. Manual Coolify server investigation
2. Alternative deployment platform consideration
3. Direct Docker deployment as fallback
4. VPS deployment if needed

## Previous Commits
- Multiple deployment permission attempts
- Infrastructure configuration fixes
- Multi-site architecture implementation
