# CLAUDE.md - Technical Architecture

## Deployment Status: ✅ LIVE & VERIFIED
- Deployed to Coolify on 2025-11-04
- Both domains live with completely distinct designs
- Domain routing verified working correctly

## Application Status: ✅ PRODUCTION
- Multi-site Node.js application fully functional
- Builds successfully with npm run build:multi-site
- Server runs with exact domain-based routing
- Health endpoint /api/health working

## Domain Routing & Designs (✅ VERIFIED LIVE)
- `247420.xyz` → **247420 Digital Stoner Den** (VT323 monospace, dark theme, age verification overlay)
- `schwepe.247420.xyz` → **Schwepe's Funky Universe** (Fredoka sans-serif, light animated gradients)
- Exact domain matching (server.cjs:38) prevents cross-domain design confusion

## Site Design Details
**247420 Digital Stoner Den:**
- VT323 monospace font family
- Dark background (#1a1a1a, #0d0d0d)
- Age verification modal on load
- Terminal-style navigation (`./home.sh`, `./lore.html`, etc.)
- Stoner/creative chaos branding

**Schwepe's Funky Universe:**
- Fredoka sans-serif font
- Animated gradient background (blue, green, purple cycling)
- Floating shape animations
- Clean feature cards (Sacred Texts, Creation Gallery, Visual Archives)
- Meme culture branding

## Technical Architecture
- Runtime: Node.js 20 Alpine
- Build System: Custom multi-site builder
- Sites: 247420, schwepe
- Server: Express.js with static file serving and domain-based routing
- Container: Docker with nixpacks build

## Implementation Notes
- Each domain gets its own site directory with separate templates
- Build system renders templates with site-specific config
- CSS-in-head approach for instant styling (no external stylesheets)
- Clean, minimal HTML structure for fast rendering
